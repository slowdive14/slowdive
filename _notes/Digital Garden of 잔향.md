### Welcome!

My name is SONG-IN, OH.🙂

This is my digital garden.🌼

I am testing this site.

1. I am a Clinical Psychologist in South Korea.
2. I write articles on [my blog](https://slowdive14.tistory.com/).
3. Nowadays, I'm insanely curious about knowledge management.
4. I think about how to use this site more effectively to organize my thoughts.
5. You can directly reach me in [my twitter account](https://twitter.com/slowdive15) or lookdiffangle@gmail.com

You can find some links of note below that is good to start exploring.🚀
