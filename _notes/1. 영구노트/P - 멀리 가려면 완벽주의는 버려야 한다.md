>And so their lana learning journey is probably a lot more smooth, only there are fewer obstacles, whereas adults will put all sorts of obstacles in their i'm not good enough for this.

>We think stuff like, yes, that person has a better accent than me. Or, _i'm not sure i'm good enough to reach my goal of being completely fluent._ And another popular one, everyone smarter than me because they speak perfect english. I'd rather have that. I'd rather show our students. I think, i think your listeners and your students ethan are probably at a similar, similar level, right the intermediate to advanced.
