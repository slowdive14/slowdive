>A second brain is my term for a system of knowledge management. So system of knowledge management. More concretely, you can think of that as a system for digital note taking. So it's the age old practice of note taking, writing down bits of inspiration, quotes, facts, research, journaling your own thoughts, your own reflections, all of that stuff, except leveraging the incredible capabilities of technology. To me, it more than just like a scribble on a pad that you stuff in a drawer, and something more like **a lifelong a a life long incubator, a life long engine of insight and creativity and productivity.** That's really what i mean by a second brain. And that term just comes from **the idea that we can extend the capabilities of our mind for the first time in history to are computers and our smart phones** and social media and software. That's where a second brain comes from.
