>Many different processes are involved in creativity, which, according to the dual pathway to creativity model, can be divided into two broad types: cognitive flexibility and cognitive persistence (Boot et al., 2017d; Mekern et al., 2019; Nijstad et al., 2010). Cognitive flexibility, the ease with which people can switch to a different approach or consider a different perspective, involves processes such as seeing associations between concepts that are only remotely related and switching between different task approaches (Nijstad et al., 2010) (중략) The second broad type of creative thinking is cognitive persistence, defined as the degree of sustained and focused task-directed cognitive effort. It is characterized by sustained, goal-directed processes needing focused attention over an extended period of time (Lucas & Nordgren, 2015; Nijstad et al., 2010; Roskes etal., 2012).
