>One of the biggest culprits? <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Mental time travel</mark>. We do it all the time. We do it seamlessly. And we do it even more under stress. Under stress, our attention gets yanked into the past by a memory, where we get stuck in a ruminative loop. Or we may get launched into the future by a worry, leading us to catastrophize on an endless number of doomsday scenarios. <br><br>

><u>The common denominator is that stressful intervals hijack attention away from the present moment</u>. This is how mindfulness first entered my lab as a possible “brain-training tool.” <br><br>

>I wanted to know whether training our participants in mindfulness exercises could help them be more effective in high-pressure situations. (가설) <br><br>

>Our basic definition of mindfulness was this: paying attention to present-moment experience without conceptual elaboration or emotional reactivity. (마음챙김의 정의 자체가 판단이나 감정에 매몰됨 없이 현재 순간에 주의를 기울이는 것)
