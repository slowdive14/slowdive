P - 문제 해결의 실마리를 잡기 위해서는 시행착오 과정에서 한 번 더 해보려는 태도가 중요하다

>In our household, my children once had a toy that was a 2-foottall replica of R2-D2 from Star Wars. When turned on, R2-D2 started marching forward in a straight line, shuffling his plastic legs like a soldier marching in formation. When he bumped into something, he would bounce back a little, and then march forward again. He might bump into the wall, or some immovable object, again and again, but each time he bounced backward, it would be at a slightly different angle. Over time, he might “get stuck” for a minute or two, hitting the same wall or fixed object, until he rotated sufficiently that he would move past the wall, on to another obstacle. Life for R2-D2 involved constant movement and one obstacle after another. He never would stop (until we switched him off!).

>Similarly, as DBT therapists we continue to move, hitting obstacles (oppositions), bouncing back, rotating (using different strategies or variations of the same ones), again and again without visible progress, until things shift sufficiently to bring clinical change.

생각의 확장 :
- 가시적인 진전이나 성과를 이루기까지 수많은 시행착오가 필요할 수 있지만, 중요한 것은 될 때까지 해보려는 태도인 것 같다.
- 변하지 않는 것처럼 보일 때조차 모든 것은 늘 변하고 있고, 풀리지 않는 문제도 언젠가는 해결의 실마리를 잡게 돼 있다.
