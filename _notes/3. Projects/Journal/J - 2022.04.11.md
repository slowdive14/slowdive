I excercise every day. I value my health the most. 

When I was 16 years old, I was sick. I had a stomach problem that needed surgery. So I was hospitalized for one month, then I had surgery.

After the event I have been worried about health. My coping strategy is exercising.

I decided to start exercise in earnest when I was in my mid-twenties. I went to the gym about more than three times every week. My main exercises were bench press, running, let pull down, over head press, and dips.

As I got older, I would walk more than doing weight training. For example, my favorite thing to do is going hiking at a mountain and going for walk near my house. Then in 2016, I met my wife at Bukhansan Mountain in Seoul.

I can't go hiking these days because my kids are too young, but as I mentioned earlier, I exercise every day in my living room. Push ups and pull ups are an easy way to exercise at home. I check my exercise routine every day. 10 push ups and 5 pull ups is all. That's easy, so I can alway afford to do that.
