My English friend Jay played acoustic guitar when we were chatting on Whatsapp. I heard that he sometimes plays guitar, and asked him to play guitar. He played some Maroon 5 songs and I watched him play. I felt that he really enjoyed it and it made me interested. I wanted to play guitar, however instead of doing that I sent him [my cover song from my most favorite band](https://youtu.be/upLHoOKwaT0).

This time I didn't prepare any topic, so I felt a little bit nervous, but because I didn't prepare, the conversation became more natural. I don't have to prepare topic every conversation. Sometimes I need to talk freely.
