I talked with Jay who is my language exchange partner from England. He had met a broker who manages his contract about his house early in the morning, so we talked 20 minutes later than usual. He had searched for new real estate, and looked a little bit tired. I said him that I hope he gets the new house that he wants.

A week ago, I requested him to send his music playlist. He sent me his recent playlist. We talked about the list. He listened to EDM for example [Sickick](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8DgGTf8jzs). I thought the artist makes trendy vibes, and when going to the gym or work, the music makes me pumped. It's not like my favorite music or genre, but it's a little impressive.

After talking about music, we moved on to the theme of language learning. Recently he began studying Korean. He can only speak a few words. Korean is one of the most difficult language to learn. I encouraged him and I said that I understood him enough. He told me a secret from his childhood, I can't say the secret but It gave me some courage to speak English. Although I'm not confident with my speaking skill but I hope I will speak fluently someday wholeheartedly.
